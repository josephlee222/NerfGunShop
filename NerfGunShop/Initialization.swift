    insertCategory(name: "Nerf Blasters", description: "A Nerf Blaster is a toy gun made by Hasbro that fires foam darts, discs, or foam balls. The term 'Nerf gun' is often used to describe the toy; however, it is often used as a blanket term for any foam dart blaster, regardless of whether or not it has the Nerf brand name. Nerf blasters are manufactured in multiple forms; the first Nerf blasters emerged in the late 1980s with the release of the Nerf Blast-a-Ball and Arrowstorm. Today, Hasbro has produced over twenty unique lines of Nerf-brand blasters, which each line centered around a particular theme or type of ammunition. Moreover, Hasbro has also produced Nerf blasters based around specific franchises, including Marvel Comics, Star Wars, G.I. Joe, Fortnite, Transformers, Overwatch, Halo Infinite, and Roblox. Nerf blasters are available in several international markets, although some blasters have their names changed or are not sold in certain countries due to laws surrounding toy safety.", imageName: "nerf_logo")
